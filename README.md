You need the following libraries of python:

In the code, you are going to find 3 types of boundaries for 3 types of colors, they are the boundaries for the object that you want to use.

You have to put the object in front of the camera and move it to move the white car and to avoid to crash with the blue car, yellow car, red car and the green car.
